##A stack is a linear data structure that follows a specific order for its operations. The order can be either LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). Here’s what these terms mean:

##1- LIFO (Last In First Out):
In a LIFO stack, the last element that was inserted (or pushed) into the stack is the first one to be removed (or popped) from it.
Imagine a stack of plates in a canteen: The plate at the top is the first to be taken, while the one at the bottom remains in the stack the longest.
Real-life examples include function call stacks, undo/redo functionality in software, and managing browser history.

##2-FILO (First In Last Out):
In a FILO stack, the first element inserted is the last one to be removed.
Although less common, this order is also valid for certain scenarios.

##Key Characteristics of a Stack:

Top: The end where elements are added or removed (like the top plate in our analogy).

Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.

Pop: Removing an element from the top of the stack.

Peek/Top Operation: Viewing the top element without removing it.

Empty Stack: When no elements are present.

Real-Life Analogy: Think of a stack as a pile of plates—each new plate goes on top, and when you need one, you take it from the top.

##Applications:

Expression Evaluation: Stacks help evaluate expressions (e.g., parentheses matching).
Backtracking Algorithms: Used in backtracking problems.
Memory Management: Function call stacks, managing local variables.
Parsing: Parsing expressions, syntax analysis
